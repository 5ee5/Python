All of my python projects.

To run the projects you need to have python installed on your system.

On windows
You need to visit https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
and download appropriate version for your system.

On linux you can install python with you system's package manager.

Arch:
```bash
sudo pacman -S python
```

Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install python
```

Fedora: 
```bash
sudo dnf install python
```

Gentoo:
```bash
sudo emerge python
```

Then you can just run the in the following ways:

On windows:
Double click on the .py file and it will automaticly run

On linux:
```bash
python filename.py
```
replace "filename.py" with correct file name.
